arp-spoof : a cli tool used to setup a man-in-the-middle attack


- What is a man-in-the-middle attack ?

A man-in-the-middle attack is a kind of cyber attack in which the attacker proxies a connection bewteen
two hosts on a local network (LAN).

The idea is to make the targets think they talk to each other when in reality all communication goes through
the attacker's machine.

Let's name the attacker's computer A, the target computer B and the local network's router R.
In the eyes of R, B is A and in the eyes of B, R is also A. This means that A will be able to see
everything that B sends to R. In this case, R is a router so A will see all web pages that B goes on.



- How does it work ?

This attack is made possible thanks to the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP). The goal of this protocol is
to map the IP address of a host on the local network to its actual MAC address (physical address).
Without this mapping, the hosts would be unable to talk to each other.
